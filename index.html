	<h1>A Day in the Life of a Student at the University of Georgia</h1>
	<h3>Let me introduce myself...</h3>
	<p> My name is Ivan Alejandro <del>Lopez</del> Castillo. The <i>Lopez</i> was removed voluntarily when 
		I decided to go through the process of becoming a <abbr title="United States of America">USA</abbr> citizen.
		I am currently a second-year business student at UGA. My focus is in Finance and I was accepted into the 
		well-known <strong>Terry College of Business</strong> in October 2017. I graduated high school almost a year-and-a-half ago from Spalding High School in Griffin, GA.
		A notable mention is that I graduated with honors as well as the Valedictorian for the class of 2016. Here's a picture of me below so you can get an 
		idea of who I am before I tell you my UGA experience.</p>

	<p> So let's begin by giving you some insights on my freshman year. As most freshman are, I was shy, unprepared for the new college environment, and 
		socially awkward. These traits put together resulted in an interesting first year overall. I should also mention that I have a memorable sense of humor 
		that makes me charismatic. Therefore, although I was shy and made no attempt to make friends, I usually had people inviting me to events or to eat. However,
		I didn't see my "anti-socialness" as a flaw. It was a blessing because without many people, I was able to focus on my courses and get superb grades. I like to 
		keep my grades to myself, but I will share with you the list of classes I completed my first year here at UGA. The number in the brackets next to the course is
		intended to let you know the amount of credit hours the course was.</p>
		<h4>Classes Taken Fall 2016 and Spring 2017</h4>
	<ul>
		<li> Accounting 1(3)</li>
		<li> Introduction to Microeconomics (3)</li>
		<li> English 1102 (3)</li>
		<li> Physical Geography (3)</li>
		<li> Physical Geography Lab (1)</li>
		<li> Accounting 2 (3)</li>
		<li> Introduction to the Legal Environment of Business (3)</li>
		<li> Management Information Systems 2090 (3)</li>
		<li> First Year Odyssey Seminar (3)</li>
		<li> Ecology (3)</li>
		<li> Intrapersonal Communications (3)</li>
	</ul>
	<p> After a full year, I was able to leave my spring semester with thirty-one credit hours successfully completed. Now, I wasn't in Terry yet because I was one 
		entrance requirement short: MSIT 3000. Therefore, this semester my schedule includes that necessary credit and three other classes that can be used to satisfy other graduation requirements.
		Below is a copy of my schedule, which will give you a good idea of what my days are like on a weekly basis.</p>

	<h3>Outside of Academics...</h3>
	<p>Outside of my studies, which are the reason I'm here at UGA, I attempt to stay busy and involved. I am an active member in Greek Life as well as in 
	hispanic student organizations on campus. I was part of the crew that made Noche Latina possible back in October. In my free time I occasionally visit the gym, 
	but for the most part you can find me at Best Buy on the Oconee Connector. I got hired early October as an Occasional/Seasonal Sales Consultant and have been 
	experiencing the sales side for almost two months now.</p>
	<p>I attempt to go to many networking events; my favorite are career fairs. I recently signed with Textron Aviation in Wichita, Kansas for a Summer 2018 internship
	in their finance department. Prior to this venture, I have interned twice at United Bank: the first time in their loan department and the second in their 
	retail delivery sector.</p> 
	<p>My favorite pass time altogether is listening to music. I'm in love with anything audio and my favorite genre is hip-hop because of its lyrical aspect.
	I enjoy listening to artists like Drake, NAS, Big Sean, J Cole, etc. and dissecting their rhymes to reveal the complex structure of syllables and internal rhymes.
	I'm usually astonished by their creativity, but I can't say that they don't occasionally disappoint because they do.</p>
	<p>My favorite thing to do on campus is attend the UGA football games and spend time with friends throughout the week and weekend. The GA Dawgs were undefeated until
	   recently, which meant that game day was even more hype than regularly. There's always socials on the weekends that end in late nights and great memories.</p>
	<h3>What else is there to say?</h3>
	<p> I know my report focused specifically on my academics and what I do at UGA. However, each and every single Dawg has their own unique experience at UGA. 
	There's an endless amount of activities to get involved in; there's an endless amount of majors to choose from in case you're not sure what your passion is; the campus 
	is beyond beautiful and the school is always working on its expansion and maintenance; and most importantly, there's a huge group of interesting and good people here.
	This place wouldn't be what it is without the awesome student body and staff that keep the place together. If you're considering a University, consider this one
	because you won't find another like it. This place has endless opportunities as well as an endless amount of people to meet. All you have to do is jump out of your 
	comfort zone, become a UGA Dawg, and then take those opportunities. I'm not saying the journey won't be tough, all I'm saying is that it will be worth it...</p>
